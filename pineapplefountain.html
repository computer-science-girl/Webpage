  <p align="center">You must stop by Charleston's Pineapple Fountain one evening! Located in the heart of Charleston'eight acre Waterfront Square Park, it overlooks the Charleston Harbor, proving one of the best spots to watch sunsets. Just as pineapples in Charleston represent hospitality, everyone is welcome to visit, take pictures with, and wade in the Pineapple Fountain.</p><br><br>
