  <p align="center">Lowndes Grove was constructed in the 1700s and once visited by President Theodore Roosevelt. Today, it sits on 14 acres of beautifully landscaped land and gardens that overlook the Charleston penninsula. Its beautiful historical architecture meets modern day, as the home is also recognized as the home of the Camerons in the hit Netflix Series OUTER BANKS. If you stop by Lowndes Grove before the end of June, you might run into the show's cast while they are filming!</p><br><br>
